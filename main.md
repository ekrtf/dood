Machine Learning in Tourism
===========================

How is machine learning reshaping industries? The case of tourism.

# Introduction
>Describe where the field of Machine Learning is today.
>Describe where the Tourism industry is today.
>Outline the benefits ML could have on Tourism for its consumers.

It’s a magical world we’re living in. Systems around us are getting smarter everyday. Our pictures can recognise us and our taxis drive themselves. These outstanding breakthrough have been made possible thanks to Machine Learning. It is the process of training a computer to react to situations without being explicitly programmed to.

Humanity is becoming proficient in specialized AI.

Machine Learning is reshaping entire industries. Destroying professions while creating new jobs. The economical impact cannot be ignored. From unemployment to wealth creation.

Business decision making techniques are changing completely. Predictions are more accurate.

The tourism industry could also see its key components change with machine learning advances. Today it is limited to flight search engine with Google Flights now able to tell you when the airline fare will increase.

**Are these only helpful features or game changers?**

Imagine being able to plan your getaway by entering wishes rather than specifications. See the difference between “I want to go to Rome from 10/19 to 10/21 by plane and stay in a hotel for less than 400 pounds” and “I wish to find a romantic place for two days”.

Is that achievable? What does it mean from the customer’s perspective? From the tourism professional's perspective?

People in the hospitality could focus on giving a better experience rather than competing to be the cheapest. Isn’t what hospitality is about?

Employees with less than a year of experience get on average 14 days of holiday per year. I think it’s worth spending time on finding the best solutions for that precious time off.

# Critical Literature Review
TODO: read chapter 3 of saunder to know what’s what

Is there existing solutions for consumers to look through millions of options in one search.
What classifications techniques are there?
Has a similar problem been solved?

This critical literature review will be used to identify:
An example where ML reshaped an industry
Identify the aspects of business ML affects most
Whether consumers are aware of the ML revolution


## Dedicated hardware solutions
Training models ranks among the most expensive tasks to compute for computers. Data scientists have been using powerful GPUs (graphics processing unit) to run machine learning tasks.
Facebook has developed its very own computer purposely built for AI computing at large scale. They call it “Big Sur” after the Californian reserve. It has 8 NVIDIA GPUs.

NVIDIA has been working on a miniature sized GPU for embedded systems. Targeted fields are robotics and IoT.

# Research Methodology and Design
## Research Objectives
>Find a way to categorise travel options given a set of critierias
>Confirm that computers can handle more parameters than humans
>Confirm that using machine learning to find a tour opens a lot more possible choices and narrows it down to a few choices that fit best
>Overall confirm that Machine Learning in Tourism could drastically improve customer experience

## Research Strategy
Compare the results obtained by existing solutions (i.e. travel guides) and the model found

The scenario: a couple is looking for a holiday destination next August. They have preferences and budget restrictions.

Step 1: Get a large sample of possible options from travel websites
Step 2: Ask a large group of people to label these options ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ through an interactive website
Step 3: Find the correlation between an option’s criterias and people’s answer
Step 4: Use an off-the-shelf library like scikit-learn or TensorFlow to train a function with the labeled dataset
Step 5: Test if the function can now go through an unknown set of travel options and label the options ‘Yes’ or ‘No’
Step 6: Give the same unknown dataset to professional travel guides and see if their classification is similar

# Findings and Analysis
>Gather knowledge from the results

# Conclusion
>Were the questions answered?
>Was the research objective reached?
