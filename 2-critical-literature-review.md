# Critical Literature Review
>TODO: read chapter 3 of saunder to know what’s what
>TODO: refer to PDF Evaluating the relevance of literature to your research File to confirm each choice
>Is there existing solutions for consumers to look through millions of options in one search.
>What classifications techniques are there?
>Has a similar problem been solved?

This critical literature review will be used to identify:
	* An example where ML reshaped an industry
	* Identify the aspects of business ML affects most
	* Whether consumers are aware of the ML revolution



## Dedicated hardware solutions
Training models ranks among the most expensive tasks to compute for computers. Data scientists have been using powerful GPUs (graphics processing unit) to run machine learning tasks.
Facebook has developed its very own computer purposely built for AI computing at large scale. They call it “Big Sur” after the Californian reserve. It has 8 NVIDIA GPUs.
