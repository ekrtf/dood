>Outline the benefits ML could have on Tourism for its consumers.

It’s a magical world we’re living in. Systems around us are getting smarter everyday. Our pictures can recognise us and our taxis drive themselves. These outstanding breakthrough have been made possible thanks to Machine Learning. It is the process of training a computer to react to situations without being explicitly programmed to.

Humanity is becoming proficient in specialized AI.

Machine Learning is reshaping entire industries. Destroying professions while creating new jobs. The economical impact cannot be ignored. From unemployment to wealth creation.

Business decision making techniques are changing completely. Predictions are more accurate.

The tourism industry could also see its key components change with machine learning advances. Today it is limited to flight search engine with Google Flights now able to tell you when the airline fare will increase.

**Are these only helpful features or game changers?**

Imagine being able to plan your getaway by entering wishes rather than specifications. See the difference between “I want to go to Rome from 10/19 to 10/21 by plane and stay in a hotel for less than 400 pounds” and “I wish to find a romantic place for two days”.

Is that achievable? What does it mean from the customer’s perspective? From the tourism professional's perspective?

People in the hospitality could focus on giving a better experience rather than competing to be the cheapest. Isn’t what hospitality is about?

Employees with less than a year of experience get on average 14 days of holiday per year. I think it’s worth spending time on finding the best solutions for that precious time off.
