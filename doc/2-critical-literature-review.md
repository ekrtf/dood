# Critical Literature Review
>TODO: read chapter 3 of saunder to know what’s what
>TODO: refer to PDF Evaluating the relevance of literature to your research File to confirm each choice
>Is there existing solutions for consumers to look through millions of options in one search.
>What classifications techniques are there?
>Has a similar problem been solved?

This critical literature review will be used to identify:
	* The signs or rise of ML
	* How ML is reshaping industries
	* How information systems have been used in tourism to drive sales
	* Prove that better HCI means more sales

## The rise of ML

Machine learning defers from traditional computer based problem solving. The traditional approach consists in having an input and an algorithm that would transform the input into a desired output. In most machine learning frameworks, we need to know a set of outputs - the training set. We use the training set to make the machine *learn* an algorithm by itself. That way we can later transform an input into an output - withtout having explicitely programmed the algorithm.

### It's happening
Every iOS user, checkbook holder or ... have been benefiting from ML for years.

### Dedicated hardware solutions
Training models ranks among the most expensive tasks to compute for computers. Data scientists have been using powerful GPUs (graphics processing unit) to run machine learning tasks.
Facebook has developed its very own computer purposely built for AI computing at large scale. They call it “Big Sur” after the Californian reserve. It has 8 NVIDIA GPUs.

NVIDIA has been working on a miniature sized GPU for embedded systems. Targeted fields are robotics and IoT.


## Industries where ML did wonders

### Banking - check reader machine
Early in the 90's ML techniques became crutial in financial services processes with the check reader machine. Credit Mutuel de Bretagne was the first firm ever to buy a check reader machine.

Bell Labs 1995: developed a convolutional neural network able to recognise hand written characters with extrem accuracy.

By 2000, 10% to 20% of world's checks were processed by this machine.

### Automobile - self driving cars
Tesla recently anounced that all vehicles produced as of october 19th 2016 will come as standard with all the necessary hardware for autonomous driving.
