// TODO: talk about customer centricity and how it has become a priority for business, shift to UX on digital products.

// TODO: to back up the asumption that the current search process is lame, emphisis on the fact that most commerce information systems give product recommendations on top of the search results. This is redundant. I say, if the system has things to recommand then display it first hand. Reference for seach (Dellaert and Haubl, 2012).

It’s a magical world we’re living in. Systems around us are getting smarter everyday. Our pictures can recognise us and our taxis drive themselves. These outstanding breakthrough have been made possible thanks to Machine Learning. It is the process of training a computer to react to situations without being explicitly programmed to.

Humanity is becoming proficient in specialized AI.

Machine Learning is reshaping entire industries. Destroying professions while creating new jobs. The economical impact cannot be ignored. From unemployment to wealth creation. Business decision making techniques are changing completely. Predictions are more accurate.

The tourism industry have been using infromation systems since its very inception. Over the past decade we witnessed a drastic change in the way people buy tourism activities. Today, we can search and compare thousands of airline tickets at a finger tip.
--> I believe we can take the experience further by using ML techniques to improve the search process

The tourism industry could also see its key components change with machine learning advances. Today it is limited to flight search engine with Google Flights now able to tell you when the airline fare will increase.

Are these only helpful features or game changers?

## Research question(s)
**How can ML techniques be used to improve human computer interaction and drive sales in the tourism industry?**

Keywords:
* human computer interaction
* smarter business process
* better user experience
* easy search process


## Warm-up
Imagine being able to plan your getaway by entering wishes rather than specifications. See the difference between “I want to go to Rome from 10/19 to 10/21 by plane and stay in a hotel for less than 400 pounds” and “I wish to find a romantic place for two days”.

Is that achievable? What does it mean from the customer’s perspective? From the tourism professional's perspective?

People in the hospitality could focus on giving a better experience rather than competing to be the cheapest. Isn’t what hospitality is about?

Employees with less than a year of experience get on average 14 days of holiday per year. I think it’s worth spending time on finding the best solutions for that precious time off.
