<p>// TODO: talk about customer centricity and how it has become a priority for business, shift to UX on digital products. https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247555 http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2016/07/19/organizational-success-starts-with-an-integrated-customer-experience-model/#99d4c6c73462</p>
<p>// TODO: talk about milenials and the fact that they prioritize experience over else. https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html</p>
<p>It’s a magical world we’re living in. Systems around us are getting smarter everyday. Our pictures can recognise us and our taxis drive themselves. These outstanding breakthrough have been made possible thanks to Machine Learning. It is the process of training a computer to react to situations without being explicitly programmed to.</p>
<p>Humanity is becoming proficient in specialized AI.</p>
<p>Machine Learning is reshaping entire industries. Destroying professions while creating new jobs. The economical impact cannot be ignored. From unemployment to wealth creation. Business decision making techniques are changing completely. Predictions are more accurate.</p>
<p>The tourism industry have been using infromation systems since its very inception. Over the past decade we witnessed a drastic change in the way people buy tourism activities. Today, we can search and compare thousands of airline tickets at a finger tip. –&gt; I believe we can take the experience further by using ML techniques to improve the search process</p>
<p>The tourism industry could also see its key components change with machine learning advances. Today it is limited to flight search engine with Google Flights now able to tell you when the airline fare will increase. https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/17/google-flights-will-now-tell-you-when-fares-will-increase-help-you-find-cheaper-tickets/</p>
<p>Are these only helpful features or game changers?</p>
<h2 id="research-questions">Research question(s)</h2>
<p><strong>How can ML techniques be used to improve human computer interaction and drive sales in the tourism industry?</strong></p>
<p>Keywords: * human computer interaction * smarter business process * better user experience * easy search process</p>
<h2 id="warm-up">Warm-up</h2>
<p>Imagine being able to plan your getaway by entering wishes rather than specifications. See the difference between “I want to go to Rome from 10/19 to 10/21 by plane and stay in a hotel for less than 400 pounds” and “I wish to find a romantic place for two days”.</p>
<p>Is that achievable? What does it mean from the customer’s perspective? From the tourism professional’s perspective?</p>
<p>People in the hospitality could focus on giving a better experience rather than competing to be the cheapest. Isn’t what hospitality is about?</p>
<p>Employees with less than a year of experience get on average 14 days of holiday per year. I think it’s worth spending time on finding the best solutions for that precious time off. http://www.salary.com/time-off-paid-time-off-from-work/</p>
<h1 id="critical-literature-review">Critical Literature Review</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: read chapter 3 of saunder to know what’s what TODO: refer to PDF Evaluating the relevance of literature to your research File to confirm each choice Is there existing solutions for consumers to look through millions of options in one search. What classifications techniques are there? Has a similar problem been solved?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This critical literature review will be used to identify: * The signs or rise of ML * How ML is reshaping industries * How information systems have been used in tourism to drive sales * Prove that better HCI means more sales</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-of-ml">The rise of ML</h2>
<p>Machine learning defers from traditional computer based problem solving. The traditional approach consists in having an input and an algorithm that would transform the input into a desired output. In most machine learning frameworks, we need to know a set of outputs - the training set. We use the training set to make the machine <em>learn</em> an algorithm by itself. That way we can later transform an input into an output - withtout having explicitely programmed the algorithm.</p>

<p>Every iOS user, checkbook holder or … have been benefiting from ML for years.</p>
<h3 id="dedicated-hardware-solutions">Dedicated hardware solutions</h3>
<p>Training models ranks among the most expensive tasks to compute for computers. Data scientists have been using powerful GPUs (graphics processing unit) to run machine learning tasks. Facebook has developed its very own computer purposely built for AI computing at large scale. They call it “Big Sur” after the Californian reserve. It has 8 NVIDIA GPUs.</p>

<p>NVIDIA has been working on a miniature sized GPU for embedded systems. Targeted fields are robotics and IoT.</p>

<p>Early in the 90’s ML techniques became crutial in financial services processes with the check reader machine. Credit Mutuel de Bretagne was the first firm ever to buy a check reader machine.</p>
<p>Bell Labs 1995: developed a convolutional neural network able to recognise hand written characters with extrem accuracy.</p>
<p>By 2000, 10% to 20% of world’s checks were processed by this machine.</p>

<h2 id="open-data">Open Data</h2>
<p>A big trend nowadays is Open Data. It as become increasingly popular among companies to provide a public API (Application Programming Interface) for developers to access their data.</p>
<p>Travel/tourism companies are no exeption. In fact they are quite pioneers in the field. Leaders like TripAdvisor and Yelp have published an API.</p>
<h1 id="research-methodology-and-design">Research Methodology and Design</h1>
<p>The purpose of this research is to conduct an eperiment. The eperiment consists in comparing key analytics collected on two versions of the same website. On version being driven by existing solutions - Yelp and TripAdvisor. The other driven by Machine Learning techniques provided by IBM Watson’s API.</p>
<p>======================================== Challenges to overcome: 1. find a source of data to search through</p>
<p>========================================</p>
<h2 id="research-objectives">Research Objectives</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to prove that there is a better way of looking for a travel destination than what the tourism industry currently offers. Today people search by destination, by price or by dates. I want to prove that better results can emerge from desire, feeling, atmostphere wanted and envy. Granted, these are not easily quantifiable</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Prove that Machine Learning can drastically imporve HCI</li>
<li>Prove that better HCI drives higher sales</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="research-strategy">Research Strategy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Compare the results obtained by existing solutions (i.e. travel guides) and the model found</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Objective: prove that an AI driven website offers better User Experience and in consequence drives sales</p>
<p>Experiment: A/B style</p>
<ul>
<li>make 2 versions of the same website:
<ul>
<li>1 to Yelp/TripAdvisor API</li>
<li>1 to Watson</li>
</ul></li>
<li>plug Google Analytics to both</li>
<li>send people to the site</li>
<li>compare analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>Core of the research: the layer between the user input and Watson results.</p>
<h3 id="website-1-static">Website 1: static</h3>
<p>The search section of this website will be very similar to existing websites. The form will include inputs like: * destination * start and end date * number of people</p>
<p>The user input from the UI will be used to query the TripAdvisor API and results will be returned without any additional filtering or sorting.</p>
<h3 id="website-2-ml-driven">Website 2: ML driven</h3>
<p>The search section of this website will differ. The form will be only one input asking “What would you like?”.</p>
<p>==&gt; <strong>The research consists in (1) finding a way of converting a user’s answer to the question “What would you like?” into search queries to travel sites and (2) filtering the results into innovative outputs for the user</strong></p>

<h3 id="challenge-1-finding-the-source-of-data">Challenge 1: finding the source of data</h3>
<p><strong>Observation:</strong> To conduct the proposed experiment, a large dataset of travel options is needed. That dataset will be the core material of this research.</p>
<p><strong>Problematic:</strong> Where can we find a <em>good</em> (real, unbiased, large enough) dataset to work with?</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Travel companies may be willing to share their catalog.</p>
<p><strong>Experience:</strong> The initial incentive was to reach out to travel companies and ask them to share their catalog.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> This idea immediatly introduced confidentiality concerns. For digitized travel companies their catalog is at the core of the business. Sales and prospection teams work full time on getting new listings while engineering and marketing are dedicated to delivering and creating value with that data.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Too much legal contraints. For personal reasons, I do not wish my dissertation bound to legal agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Let’s look for public data in order to avoid any legal obstacles. Luckily, travel companies do make some of their data public through an API. That’s the Open Data philosophy.</p>
